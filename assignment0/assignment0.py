## Help with:
## 1. Can you show me how to install the requests module via git hub? http://kennethreitz.org/exposures/requests
## 2. What is the best way of doing HTTP requests in Python anyways?
## 3. What is the point of having xcode. Can it compile python?
## 4. Think I know enought that I'll be okay during the comp?

### 5.c
## an indiviual team member has a (4/5) chance of surviving each round, so in 5 rounds, they have a (4/5)^5 chance of surviving. This means that they have a 1-(4/5)^5 chance of dying.
## since all team members must die in order for luigi to win by looking forward, all three team members must die. Thus Luigi's chance of winning is (1-(4/5)^5)^3. This is about .304, which is
## indeed the result of running to program through many many trials.
